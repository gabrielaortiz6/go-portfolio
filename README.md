# GMO React Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal developer (and in the future, design) portfolio, created using React and create-react-app. At the moment, there is no backend but I intend to implement it in the coming weeks. The purpose of this portfolio is to to draw in and allow prospective employers to view my biography, my previous projects, my resume, and other general information about me, while showcasing my coding abilities. 

### Technology

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
react-boostrap was used, as well as react-helmet, Google Fonts, and react-icons
